Project_Netflix_Data_Analysis


I recently worked on a Netflix data analysis project and wanted to share some of the interesting insights I discovered. In this project, I used Python and various libraries like pandas, numpy, and plotly to analyze a dataset containing information about Netflix shows. I also utilized the pandas_profiling library for detailed data profiling.

The project involved tasks such as data cleaning, visualization, and exploration. I used plotly.express and plotly.graph_objs to create interactive visualizations that helped uncover patterns and trends in the data. Additionally, I leveraged pandas_profiling to generate comprehensive reports on the dataset, providing valuable insights into its structure and characteristics.

By analyzing the dataset, I was able to extract information about the types of content available on Netflix, the countries of origin, release years, ratings, and durations of shows. I also explored the genres and categories of the shows.

Overall, the project provided me with hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization using Python. It was an exciting opportunity to apply my skills to real-world data and gain insights into the popular streaming platform, Netflix.
